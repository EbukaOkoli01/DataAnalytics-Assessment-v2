# DataAnalytics-Assessment-v2
Revisiting a past SQL assessment to demonstrate progress and improved analytical problem-solving skills in MySQL.

OVERVIEW

The DataAnalytics-Assessment-v2 project is a revisited version of a data analytics SQL challenge originally completed earlier in 2025. It contains four major business-driven questions that assess analytical thinking, SQL proficiency, and problem-solving ability using MySQL.
The database consists of three main tables — users_customer, plans_plan, and savings_savingsaccount — all connected to model customer savings behavior, transaction activities, and investment patterns.
